#What is this?

tldr:
PPS is a Fractured Soldat statistics and ranking system that intends to help players improve. Smoothly.

#How does this whole thing work?

To be tracked by PPS, *all you have to do is join any Progressive Play Server*
*You'r Hardware ID gets registerd automatically upon joining a server*

PPS tracks you by your soldat hwid(no longer ip). 
Every time you play, your in-game performance will be recorded. The ranking system then ranks the players accordingly.
PPS also can bind your soldat hwid to your qnet auth. To do this you need issue a private message to the pps bot on qnet 
with `!auth` command followed by your **secret code**. Your **secret code** is issued from the soldat server with the same command.

#How are the ratings calculated / How are the players ranked? =

PPS uses a modified system of [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/ Mircosoft's TrueSkill system].

FTA:
The !TrueSkill ranking system only uses the final standings of all teams in a game in order to update the skill estimates (ranks) of all gamers playing in this game.

That means because *only the final standings(the goal of the game; or in other words winning/losing) of all teams in a game* are used to rank players, stats whoring is impossible. *The only thing that matters* is the number of maps you have won/lost and the participating players and their ratings.
