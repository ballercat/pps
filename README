= What is this? =

tldr:
PPS is a Fractured Soldat statistics and ranking system that intends to help players improve. Smoothly.

Long version:
http://www.fracs.net/pps/info

= How does this whole thing work? =

To be tracked by PPS, *you must be a registered member of the Fractured Soldat Community.*

You can register here: http://fracs.net/bbs/ucp.php?mode=register for free.

PPS tracks you by your IP address. Please see [FAQ#Why_aren't_my_stats_recorded? here].

Every time you play, your in-game performance will be recorded. The ranking system then ranks the players accordingly. To see how the ratings and ranking work, see [FAQ#How_are_the_ratings_calculated_/_How_are_the_players_ranked? here].

= Why aren't my stats recorded? =

The system tracks you by your IP Address - *thus you must let the system know which IP you are using and tell it when your IP has changed since last visit.*

Here are the ways to have your IP Address acknowledged:
  * *If you are not logged into both the forums and the PPS website*, all you have to do is to login to *either* location.
    * *If you are already logged into the forums*, just visit the forums home page again.
      * *If you are already logged into the PPS website*, click the "Update IP" link at the top-right corner.

      = How are the ratings calculated / How are the players ranked? =

      PPS uses a modified system of [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/ Mircosoft's TrueSkill system].

      FTA:
        The !TrueSkill ranking system only uses the final standings of all teams in a game in order to update the skill estimates (ranks) of all gamers playing in this game.

        That means because *only the final standings(the goal of the game; or in other words winning/losing) of all teams in a game* are used to rank players, stats whoring is impossible. *The only thing that matters* is the number of maps you have won/lost and the participating players and their ratings.
